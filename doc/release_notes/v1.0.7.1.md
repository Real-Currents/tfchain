# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.0.7.1

This release is a patched version of the v1.0.7 release.

It brings full support for NilConditions to the web explorer,
supported by a bug fix in Rivine to allow for the string-decoding of NilUnlockHashes.

Should you upgrade directly from `v1.0.6.1`,
than please also check the release notes of `v1.0.7` at: [/doc/release_notes/v1.0.7.md](/doc/release_notes/v1.0.7.md)
