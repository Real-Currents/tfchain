# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.0.8

## Summary

* Extended version number support: supporting now build versions as well;
* Explorer module indexes all MultiSig addresses, using multiple keys, one per address which is part of the that MultiSig address;
* Improved web explorer:
* Hex-encoded blocks/transactions are no longer returned as part of explorer lookups (you can still get the hex-encoded format if you look up using the `tfchainc explore` commands;
* Custom tfchain Conditions and Transactions have been moved from the `main` pkg to a sub-pkg `pkg/types`, as to allow other tools, that are meant to plugin to the tfchain network, can make use of them as well;
* Added a documented example of an ETH-TFT atomic swap, which can be found under `/doc/atomicswap.md#Ethereum-Example`;

### Web Explorer Updates

* Coin and Block Stake balances are shown on the page of an UnlockHash;
* When the UnlockHash of an individual wallet is part of one or multiple MultiSig wallets, the addresses of these wallets will be listed on the page of that UnlockHash as well;
* When looking for a block in the web explorer you'll get as much information when doing so for the height as you would for its ID;
* Amount of confirmations are shown on the Transaction and Block pages;
* Hex-encoded blocks are no longer shown, instead the Raw block/transaction shows this raw content in JSON-encoded format;
