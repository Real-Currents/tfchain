# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.0.6.1

This release is a patched version of the v1.0.6 release.

It fixes several bugs related to the newly introduced MultiSig feature:

+ Fixes the nil-pointer exception when decoding a MultiSignatureCondition ([issue #141](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/issues/141));
+ Fixes the broken Equality check of the MultiSignatureCondition (unreported);
+ Fixes the Rivine code, in-place, as to ensure it can handle custom Condition Go-types (also fixes [#142](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/issues/142));

Should you upgrade directly from `v1.0.5`,
